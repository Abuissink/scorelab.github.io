title: OpenDebug - General Debugger tool for Distributed Systems
description: In distributed systems, that type of testing only exposes the simplest of bugs and design flaws. The really difficult parts of building distributed systems lie in the interactions between multiple processes running on multiple machines, communicating asynchronously over networks, with expected message loss and corruption, expected failure of individual running instances, expected failures of individual machines, and expected failures of sections of the network. While you'd still want unit tests to cover units of work in such a system, those unit tests will not expose issues at any of the problems at the heart of distributed systems design. And since integration tests are usually built out of unit tests, they won't catch them either. <br/> <p>References:</p> <ul type="square"> <li><a href="http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2016/02/diagnose-problems-in-your-production-apps-faster-with-Google-Cloud-Debugger.html">Diagnose problems in your production apps faster with Google Cloud Debugger</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-practices-for-debugging-distributed-systems-algorithms">What are the best practices for debugging distributed systems/algorithms?</a></li></ul>
