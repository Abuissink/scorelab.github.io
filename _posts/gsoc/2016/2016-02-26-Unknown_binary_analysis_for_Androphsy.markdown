title:  Unknown binary analysis for Androphsy
description: This module includes several tasks. Initially the module should identify known good binary files, known bad binary files and unknown binary files. This could be done by maintaining a hash value repository of binary files in Android platform. At the moment there is no such up-to-date repository available internet (NSRL does not contain comprehensive list of hashes of Android applications). After categorization, the module should enable analysis of binary files. Analysis can start by identifying permissions requested by the application.  Further binary file decomposable and debug functionality need be developed in this module in order to identify malicious artifacts of the unknown binaries.
requiredknowledge: Hashing techniques, Android application structure and security model, Java, .apk file decompile
