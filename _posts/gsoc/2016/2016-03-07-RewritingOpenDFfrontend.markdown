title:  Rewriting OpenDF frontend
description: OpenDF is a JavaEE based web application which helps forensic investigators to conduct forensic analysis. OpenDF has successfully evolved into a stage where now it is the right time to extend the application to support other platforms such as mobile apps. This task is aiming to extract front end application to a seperate HTML5 web application. After successfully creating a HTML5 app, next objective is to make current OpenDF app into a core service. You can extend the current RESTful service which communicate with the HTML5 application as well as mobile application (Hopefully in the future) where necessary. You should write Protractor tests to support your UIs.
requiredknowledge: HTML5, Twitter Bootstrap, AngularJS, Protractor, Gulp, Bower, JavaEE and other Web frameworks around Java
