title:   Redesign Tikiri-DB
description: TikiriDB is a database abstraction layer to enable a query interface to acquire required data in highly efficient manner. After setting up the sensor network with TikiriDB It is possible to gather data without having the knowledge of programming sensor nodes. TikiriDB will provide a query language which is more similar to conventional query language with additional syntax to comply with sensor network environment. TikiriDB system is composed in three parts on is installed in sensor nodes, one is installed in base-stations and the other is installed in computer connected with the base-station. The application installed in computer will provide an API to connect the your application with the database. Query processor of TikiriDB is located at sensor node. The other part which installed in base-station node will mainly handle the routing of the queries. In this project main objective is make TikiriDB compatible with newer Contiki vision.
