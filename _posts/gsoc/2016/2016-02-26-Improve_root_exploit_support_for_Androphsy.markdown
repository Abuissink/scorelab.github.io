There is no general way to gain root access in all Android smartphones as it is highly coupled with vendor, Android version, build number, kernel and model. Improve the device rooting module of androphsy by implementing more root exploits so that the tool will support wider range of Android smartphones. It is expected to automate the rooting process.
